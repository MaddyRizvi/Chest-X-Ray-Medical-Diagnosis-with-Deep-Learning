Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! ðŸŽ‰  
Please take a moment to review the following guidelines to help us maintain a smooth and productive workflow.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `chest_x_ray_model.ipynb` â€“ Jupyter Notebook containing all the code cells.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` â€“ This contribution guide.

## ðŸš€ How to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Issues
- Check existing issues before creating a new one.
- Use clear titles and provide detailed descriptions.
- Include screenshots, logs, or error messages if relevant.

### 2. Improving Documentation
- Update `chest_x_ray_model.ipynb` for explanations, formatting, or typo fixes.
- Use proper Markdown syntax for readability.
- Do **not** add executable code into `.md`. All code should go into `.ipynb`.

### 3. Contributing Code
- Add or update code only inside `chest_x_ray_model.ipynb`.
- Ensure that all cells run without errors before committing.
- Use clear variable names and comments where necessary.

### 4. Pull Requests
- Fork the repository and create a new branch for your changes.
- Follow a clear commit message style:
  - `fix:` for bug fixes
  - `feat:` for new features
  - `docs:` for documentation changes
  - `refactor:` for restructuring code without changing functionality
- Open a pull request with a description of your changes.

## âœ… Best Practices
- Keep explanations in `.md` and code in `.ipynb` separate.
- Follow [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) style for Python code.
- Add comments to explain non-obvious logic.
- Test your code with sample inputs before submitting.
